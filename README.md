# backlit-rbhw
A Really Beautiful Hello World program with a backlit background that's based off of Microsoft's Studio 6, the sixth floor of City Center Plaza in Bellevue, Washington. You can see the original <strong><a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/viNyMmcUYZ2O4/giphy.gif">here</a></strong>.

Written in HTML/CSS, JS, and GSAP (JS). 
Learned how to use TimelineLite for this project. 

### About Really Beautiful Hello World
RBHW is an ongoing series of projects that was inspired by a conversation I had with my mentor at Microsoft. 
In short, he said that programmers could either spend a bunch of time coding really beautiful Hello Worlds or move onto bigger and better things. Of course, his point was that people shouldn't get too caught up in the fringes of sanity checking, but inspiration struck and now I use RBHW as a means of trying out nifty new things. 

The RBHWs I have on GitHub are usually here because I wanted to share the files with friends/collaborators at some point or because I was trying out a new editor and wanted to get comfortable with Git/GitHub integration. All RBHWs that don't fall under these categories can be found on <a href="https://codepen.io/elmmo/">CodePen</a>.
