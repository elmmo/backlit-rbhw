A Really Beautiful Hello World program with a gradient background that's based off of Microsoft's Studio 6, the sixth floor of City Center Plaza
in Bellevue, Washington. You can see the original <strong><a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/viNyMmcUYZ2O4/giphy.gif">here</a></strong>.

### About Really Beautiful Hello World
RBHW is an ongoing series of projects that was inspired by a conversation I had with my mentor at Microsoft. 
In short, he said that programmers could either spend a bunch of time coding really beautiful Hello Worlds or move onto bigger and better things.
Of course, his point was that people shouldn't get too caught up in the fringes of sanity checking, but inspiration struck and now I use RBHW as a means of trying out nifty new 
front-end things.
